      "description": "I was born in 2013 in Cheongju, North Chungcheong Province, South Korea, and moved to Germany in 2018. After attending kindergarten (Kita) and elementary school, I am currently in 7th grade at a Gymnasium (secondary school). At first, I didn't know any German, which made it difficult to adapt to life in Germany, and I missed Korea a lot. Now that I've become better at German, I sometimes worry that my Korean has become less fluent."
